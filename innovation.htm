      <p>During my time as a graduate teaching assistant at the University of South Florida, I have had multiple opportunities to improve the efficiency of activities in and out of the classroom. For example, starting in the Spring 2016 semester, I created an automated online system and mobile application for our department's end-of-the-year Advisory Board Meeting. This is a meeting of our faculty, graduate students, and leaders from industry to evaluate the performance and ingenuity of our graduating senior chemical engineering students. The department holds a large poster session where each student group from the <i>Product and Process Design</i> course is represented and defends their project design proposal. Previously, students would give a short presentation of their project, while board members and graduates would visit posters and judge each one based on ABET criteria. This is an integral part of maintaining the accreditation of the Department of Chemical &amp; Biomedical Engineering here at USF. My automation steps were two-fold: due to growing class sizes, I created a system of recording every group's presentations ahead of time to be emailed to the advisory board members; and to reduce the load on graduate students during the judging process, I developed a mobile application to record responses from each judge and automatically evaluate which groups were most successful in their design experience. The new process received accolades from many faculty and judges, including the department chair. Our department has utilized my system for the past three years and plans to continue its use well after I graduate.</p>

      <p>I have also been instrumental in incorporating a flipped-style classroom in our design course sequence, where class interaction has shifted from lecture-only material to a more balanced load of lecture and whole class discussion, interspersed with check-your-understanding questions provided by instructors and TAs, alike. The new system removes some of the monotony of sitting in class and copying notes from the board, and gives students a chance to engage with each other and the instructors to solve open-ended problems. The <a href="https://tophat.com">active learning system</a> I proposed to assist with these tasks and provide automated, real-time feedback for the professor has become a staple in not only the courses I have taught, but has been adopted by most of our department, as well. In addition to providing needed relief for students to practice what they're learning, it gives instructors an opportunity to see which concepts that students are not understanding and to evaluate the effectiveness of their own teaching practices.</p>
